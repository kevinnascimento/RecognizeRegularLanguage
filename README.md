Recognize Regular Language
========================

The recognition of a regular language validated by the automaton in the following language: 

L = { w |  w ε {a, b, c}+ ^ w é definida por:  a+ (b a (aa)*)* | (aa)* (b | c) ((b | c)² )*

But it is possible to change the automaton in MainController class, loadAutomata method.
